# Artifacts for ASPLOS 2023 Paper "<strong>CaT</strong>: A Solver-Aided Compiler for Packet Processing Pipelines"


  - Artifact evaluation instructions and ILP program for resource allocation (in addition to AE appendix in the CaT paper): https://github.com/CaT-mindepth/CaT-AE
  - Augmented p4c preprocessor for parsing table dependencies and extracting Domino programs from P4 action blocks: https://github.com/CaT-mindepth/p4c
  - Preprocessor of every extracted P4 action block: https://github.com/CaT-mindepth/CaT-Preprocessor
  - Program synthesis-based code generator for each action to low-level P4 code (Tofino backend) or FPGA output (Menshen backend): https://github.com/CaT-mindepth/minDepthCompiler
  - Augmented Menshen FPGA code with Banzai if-else-raw stateful ALU support: https://github.com/CaT-mindepth/new_fpga_cat
